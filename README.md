# Snake game written in Chez Scheme

# dependencies
The only dependency that's actually needed, other than [Chez Scheme itself](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/) is
[chez-ncurses](https://github.com/akce/chez-ncurses).

# Running the game 
The game is a conveniently self-contained .ss file named main.ss. Just run `scheme main.ss` and you'll get right in
the action! Press the enter (return) key to exit the game.
